  <h1>Sorting and Searching</h1>
  <p>This is the classic 2-sum problem. The goal is to find two distinct elements in an array whose sum equals a given target value.</p>
  <p>I began by pairing each element with its original index using tuples of the form <code>(value, index)</code>. After constructing this list of tuples, I sorted the array based on the value.</p>
  <p>Once sorted, I applied the standard two-pointer approach: I initialized two pointers â€” one at the beginning (<code>left</code>) and one at the end (<code>right</code>) of the array.</p>
  <p>In each iteration, I checked the sum of the two values at the pointers. If the sum was less than the target, I incremented the <code>left</code> pointer. If it was greater, I decremented the <code>right</code> pointer. If the sum equaled the target, I had found my solution.</p>
  <p>If the pointers crossed without finding such a pair, I concluded that no valid solution exists.</p>
